This package is meant to hold all plugins designed to enhance Vim's native
functionality. tpope plugins and the like mostly fall under this category.

Take note that this package is meant for general Vim functionality, and so must
act on text without necessarily knowing context. If a plugin relies heavily on
parsing your code to behave properly, consider moving it to the `code` package
instead.
